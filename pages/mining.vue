Efficient mining is achieved only if miners communicate between one another and requires bandwidth to be expended in lieu of processor effort. The result is a bandwidth-hard PoW that combines 2 distinct stages: announcement mining and block mining, which together, collectively decentralizes the transmission of data across a distributed global network.

Announcement miners seek to maximize the number of successful announcements which can be accepted into a block and need to maximize their bandwidth to achieve the optimal mining results. This in turn assures that the network has high throughput longitudinally. An announcement, by default, is the nodes network state. But an announcement can be any bit of data. ",

Block miners are incentivized to have lots of announcements in memory at the time of mining and must pay announcement miners to keep fresh announcements supplied.",
